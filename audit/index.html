        <h3>Penetration Testing</h3>
        <p>In order to beat the bad guys, you have to think like them. Penetration testing is an integral part of any effective information security program. Knowing where your vulnrebilities lie. This allows you to strenghten your security measures where necessary.

          White Forest employs some of the best cyber hackers around. We leave no stone unturned when it comes to lawfully breaking into your network. For example, there was a client who had an electronically operated gate for their paking structure. Toying with it when the President of the organization was trying to live work was fair game. They patched it up soon after.
          
          In keeping faith with our mission statement, White Forest offers this serivce at no charge. We commit our own resoruces to the engagement. This is for two reasons: <ul>
            <li>To provide Small-to-Medium Businesses the oppurtunity to arm themselves with practical knowledge in pursuit of adhereing to best practices for data security</li>
            <br>
            <li>To provide our employees with great oppurutnites for experience so that they may continously improve their skillset</li>
          </ul>
        This is a mutually benefical arrangement, and we here at White Forest are excited to be able to provide this service at no cost to you.
